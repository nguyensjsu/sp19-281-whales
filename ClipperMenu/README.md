# Introduction

There are many transportation services that can be aviled using Clipper Card. The problem with this clipper card is that there are no proper portal available to reload clipper card to use all the services. For example if we want to use Bart Train using the clipper Card, then we have go to Bart train web portal and we have to reload our clipper card, and if we want use VTA service using clipper card, then we have go to VTA service to reload out clipper card. There is no proper single application to avail all the services using clipper card. In this project, we are building the prototype to overcome this problem.

# Responsibility

The application that we are building, called eClipper consists of 4 microservices such as Login and Session Management, Menu Service, Payment Service and user services. My responsibality in this project is to develop menu microservice for the application.

# Functionality of Menu Service

The main functionality of menu service is to display the available services for clipper card on mentioning the zip code. If the user mentions the Zip Code of the perticular region, then the user will get all the services available in that region. The detail architecture of the application is provided below.
